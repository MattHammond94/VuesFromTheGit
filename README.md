# VUE

> Learning vue by following online materials.

### Setup

> ```npx create-vue@latest``` - Then select requirements at setup stage. On creation run an rpm install. 

### How does Vue differ to react? 

> Conventions: Vue will conventionally break each component down into 3 different sections: 

* The output (or template): The html being rendered by said component - Will usually be placed within a template tag.

* The logic (or functionality/Js): The functionality for this compoent - Usuall within a script tag.

* The styling: The styling doesn't have to be within a style tag can be imported globally but when used within a style tag ```scoped``` can be applied to the tag to ensure the styles within component will only apply here.
